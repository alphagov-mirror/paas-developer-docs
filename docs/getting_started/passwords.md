When setting a password for your Government PaaS account, it is important to choose one that is both unique and resistant to attack. 

We reserve the right to suspend your account if we detect that it has an insecure password.

Follow these rules when setting your password:

* Your password for the PaaS should be unique. You should not have used it as a password anywhere else.
* Your password must be longer than eight characters, although it may not be longer than 255 characters.
* Your password should not be common (such as `12345678` or `qwertyuiop`), or a single dictionary word (such as `football` or `welcome`). 
* If you must use a memorable password, use [three words in a short sentence](https://www.cyberaware.gov.uk/passwords).
* We recommend that you generate and store your passwords with password manager software, like [Lastpass](https://www.lastpass.com), [1Password](https://1password.com), or [KeePass](http://keepass.info).

Your session will expire 7 days after logging in using the `cf` command line tool, and you will be prompted to log in again.
