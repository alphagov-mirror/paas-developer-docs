It is expected that users dynamically join and leave the platform as they work on different projects and join/leave jobs in real life. User life cycle management and responsibilities are currently split between PaaS support and [Org managers](manage_users.md#Organisation manager).

### Onboarding
User creation is currently handled by PaaS support.

If you are looking to start a new project on the platform, please do reach us and indicate this. We'll get in touch and apart from creating your user account, we'll also create an appropriately sized organization. We will be creating [org manager](manage_users.md#organisation-manager) account first, meaning you should have decided who will have this role/responsibility in your team/project.

If you are a new user to be added to an existing org, we'll need your manager approval (unless the account creation is already raised by the org manager). We'll create your account and you will be added to the org and the default 'sandbox' space. Your org manager will then add you to spaces you need to be member of to do your work on the project.

### Deleting users
When team members stop working on projects, or even leave GDS, their access rights and even accounts should be revoked. When this situation happens, it is duty of org manager to _immediately_ remove user rights and roles (e.g. space developer) that allow users to manage existing apps and services. If the user is only leaving one project (organisation), but still need to manage other projects in other organisations, nothing more needs to be done. But if this is the last project of the user, then the org manager of that last project should raise a support request with PaaS support to completely remove the user account from the platform.
