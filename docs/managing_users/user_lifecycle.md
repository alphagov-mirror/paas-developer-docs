Users will need to be added or removed from the Government PaaS as they join or leave your team.

The responsibility for managing the user lifecycle is split between Government PaaS support and the [Org Manager](/manage_users#Organisation-manager) on your team. 

[comment]: # (do we actually allow more than one Org Manager??)

This section explains what needs to be done to create or delete users.

### Creating users
User creation is currently handled by our support team.

If you are looking to start a new project on the platform, please contact us at [gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:gov-uk-paas-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk). We'll get in touch and create your user account and organisation. We will create the [Org Manager](/manage_users#organisation-manager) account first, meaning you should have decided who will have this responsibility in your team/project.

If you are a new user to be added to an existing org, we'll need your manager's approval. We'll create your account and you will be added to the org and the default 'sandbox' space. Your Org Manager will then grant you any additional user roles you need.

[comment]: # (why don't Org Managers just create users directly? CF allows this and the previous section says they can to. what happens if they do? should we say not to?)

### Deleting users

When a team member leaves or stops working on a project, their access rights should be revoked. 

When this situation happens, an Org Manager must _immediately_ remove all user roles (e.g. Space Developer) that allow the user to manage existing apps and services. 

If the user is only leaving one project, but still needs access on the PaaS to work on other projects in other organisations, nothing more needs to be done. 

If the user no longer needs access to the Government PaaS, then the Org Manager should raise a support request with PaaS support to completely remove the user account from the platform.
