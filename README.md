# DEPRECATED

This is the old Government PaaS Developer Docs system. We have transitioning to the new system (see https://github.com/alphagov/paas-tech-docs). If you need to make docs changes, make them in the new system.

This repository now contains a mkdocs site that redirects all the old documentation hosted on readthedocs to the new documentation hosted on the PaaS.
